# Blog Images Directory

This directory contains featured images for blog posts.

## Required Images

For the blog to display properly, you'll need to add the following images to this directory:

1. `blog-hero.jpg` - General blog header image (1200x630px recommended)
2. `kitchen-remodeling-cost.jpg` - Featured image for kitchen cost guide
3. `bathroom-trends-2025.jpg` - Featured image for bathroom trends post
4. `choosing-contractor.jpg` - Featured image for contractor guide
5. `basement-finishing.jpg` - Featured image for basement finishing guide
6. `flooring-options.jpg` - Featured image for flooring options post
7. `default.jpg` - Fallback image for posts without featured images

## Image Specifications

- **Format**: JPG or WebP recommended
- **Dimensions**: 1200x630px (Open Graph standard) or 16:9 aspect ratio
- **Size**: Optimize to under 200KB for fast loading
- **Content**: Should relate to the blog post topic
- **Alt Text**: Already defined in MDX frontmatter

## Adding Images

1. Place optimized images in this `/public/blog/` directory
2. Reference them in MDX frontmatter as: `/blog/image-name.jpg`
3. Images will be automatically served from the public directory

## Optimization Tips

- Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim to compress images
- Consider converting to WebP format for better compression
- Ensure images are relevant and high-quality
- Use descriptive file names for SEO

## Temporary Placeholder

Until you add real images, the blog posts will reference these image paths. You can:
1. Add real photos from your portfolio
2. Use stock photos (ensure you have rights)
3. Create custom graphics
4. Take new photos specifically for blog content
