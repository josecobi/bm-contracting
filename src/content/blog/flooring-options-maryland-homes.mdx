Choosing the right flooring is one of the most important decisions you'll make during a home renovation. Flooring affects your home's aesthetics, comfort, maintenance requirements, and value—while representing a significant portion of your remodeling budget. As Maryland's experienced flooring installation experts, we've helped hundreds of homeowners navigate this decision, and we're sharing our comprehensive guide to help you choose the perfect flooring for your space.

## Maryland Climate Considerations for Flooring

Before diving into specific flooring types, understanding Maryland's climate helps narrow your options:

### Climate Challenges

- **Humidity Fluctuations**: Hot, humid summers and dry winters cause expansion and contraction
- **Temperature Variations**: Seasonal extremes affect some flooring materials
- **Moisture**: Basements and lower levels often face humidity challenges
- **Four Seasons**: Flooring must perform well year-round

The best flooring for Maryland homes balances durability, moisture resistance, and temperature stability.

## Hardwood Flooring: Timeless Beauty

Hardwood remains the gold standard for flooring, offering unmatched beauty and value.

### Types of Hardwood

**Solid Hardwood**:
- 3/4-inch thick boards of pure wood
- Can be refinished multiple times
- Best for above-grade installations
- Traditional and highly valued

**Engineered Hardwood**:

- More stable in humidity fluctuations
- Suitable for basements and below-grade
- Limited refinishing (1-2 times)
